`Simplify.Web.Swagger` is a package which provides Swagger generation for [Simplify.Web](https://github.com/SimplifyNet/Simplify.Web) web-framework controllers.

## Quick Start

1. Add `Simplify.Web.Swagger`, `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen` and `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI` packages to your project

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Simplify.Web.Swagger" Version="1.0.*" />
<PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen" Version="6.6.*" />
<PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI" Version="6.6.*" />
```

1. Add `AddSimplifyWebSwagger` in `AddSwaggerGen` registration and `Simplify.Web` controllers will be scanned during Swagger generation process.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer()
 .AddSwaggerGen(x => x.AddSimplifyWebSwagger());
```

3. Use Swagger as in regular ASP.NET Core project

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();

app.UseSimplifyWebWithoutRegistrations();

app.Run();
```

4. Add controller Swagger attributes (if needed)

```csharp
[Get("/api/v1/users/{id}")]
[ApiVersion("1.0")]
[ProducesResponse(StatusCodes.Status200OK, "application/json")]
[ProducesResponse(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError)]
public class GetController : Controller2
{
 ...
}
```

5. After application started go to <http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html> or <http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json> to see generated Swagger

## Example application
